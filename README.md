🚀 Responsive Analog Clock with Advanced CSS Animations ⏱️

I built a fully responsive analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on both functionality and visual design.

✨ Key Highlights:

Real-time hour, minute, and second hands using JavaScript

Fully responsive layout using vmin units

Colorful animated particles for a dynamic background

Smooth floating particles inside the clock dial for a premium look

Glassmorphism-style date display with hover animation

Clean layering using z-index, pseudo-elements, and CSS animations

This project helped me explore:

Advanced CSS animations & keyframes

Pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)

Smooth infinite background effects

UI/UX enhancement using pure CSS

Always excited to experiment with creative front-end designs and animations. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
